# Uber-Data-Analysis

>We use machine learning algorithms to predict the price of Uber, so that it is easy for the company to do analysis on price based on certain features.

>Uber uses data analytics to predict the prices of rides based on a variety of factors such as the time of day, the location of the pickup and drop-off, the distance of the ride, and the demand for rides at that particular time.

>These algorithms analyze large amounts of data from past rides and use that information to predict what the price of a ride will be under different conditions.

>In addition to machine learning algorithms, Uber also uses real-time data from its app to adjust prices dynamically. For example, if there is a sudden surge in demand for rides in a particular area, Uber may increase the price of rides in that area to encourage more drivers to go there and pick up passengers.

>Overall, data analytics plays a crucial role in helping Uber to set prices that are both competitive for riders and profitable for the company.
